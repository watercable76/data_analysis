# Development Environment

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Tools Used

The text editor I used is Visual Studio Code, as well as GitHub. I downloaded Git and connected the repo  
to my VS Code. This way I can write content while ensuring it works and is visually easier to work with.

## Programming Language
I used Python3 for this small assignment.  
Instead of using a library like Pandas, I just used python and wrote scripts to run through the data.
